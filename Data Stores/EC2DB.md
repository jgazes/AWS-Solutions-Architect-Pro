# Databases on EC2 #

- Run any database with full control and ultimate flexibility.
- Must manage everything like backups, redundancy, patching, scale
- Good option if you require a database not yet supported by RDS, such as IBM DB2 or SAP HANA.
- Good option if its not feasible to migrate to an AWS managed DB
